# FlexIt! - Fitness tracker app demo.

## About this app

*FlexIt!* is a web application designed as a modern, user-friendly, and flexible fitness tracker that allows our members to create exercise definitions, track their multiple executions, 
associate them within workouts, and monitor their personal progress through a consistent and data-oriented approach to historical performance.

The application has been built around two key elements: a backend server based on **Django + Django REST Framework** that acts as a RESTful API with a clear set of endpoints to process 
the lifecycle of the different abstractions used throughout the app, and a frontend client built with **React + Vite** designed as an SPA tightly integrated with the aforementioned API. 
Together, they provide a modern solution that users can rely on to provide a consistent and reliable service.

The application runs on Azure, leveraging the reliability of Azure Container Apps, Azure SQL, Azure Container Registry and other solutions offered by the cloud platform. As the features of
the application grow, so will the use of the services offered by the cloud provider.
